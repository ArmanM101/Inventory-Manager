## Store Inventory Management Application

- **What will the application do?**</br>
The application I want to create is an inventory management 
system for stores. It will allow the user to create a store 
and enter what products are bought and what products are
sold so that the user will have an inventory of what is 
currently in the store. Possible features include different 
categories of items; including a bought and sold price; having 
multiple stores each with their own inventory. (X could be 
an item being sold in the store. Y could be a list of items
currently in stock).
- **Who will use it?** </br>
I intend for this application to be used by store-owners in
order to keep track of their inventory. 
- **Why is this application of interest to you?** </br>
This application is of interest to me because I feel like 
it would be useful tool if I were to ever open a store of my 
own. I'm also curious as to how advanced I can make the application.
